<!-- This is the readme file for the TheOdinProject Landing Page project.
I am slightly apprehensive to start, considering how difficult I found flexboxes in an overall sense. I often found myself overcomplicating them, only to have the solutions be something I felt I had already tried.
This contributed to a general sense of frustration and malaise, which of course snowballs into losing pertinent knowledge.
That all being said, this will be worked on until it is sufficient. Content will most likely not be changed, just to ensure my work matches the example.
I am still a student! Hopefully in a few months (if not sooner) I can look back on this and say "I've come so far!"

<!-- EDIT 10minutes in and I will NOT be keeping everything the same as the example. I think attempting to make text placeholders lineup with what should be images will be more work than is needed.
Additionally, I want to make this look somewhat decent, rather than just a carbon copy. Of course, now I enter the dreaded "Find the perfect picture for everything" phase, but considering this is all amateur work, I can use that inner classification to get over that phase quicker.
ok now gg no re -->
